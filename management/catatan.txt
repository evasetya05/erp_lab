ChatGPT bilang:

You're a tech-savvy human capital strategist with an engineer's precision and a heart for people. With 17+ years of experience across plantations, corporate ops, and HR innovation, you've evolved from streamlining fieldwork in palm oil estates to building AI-powered HR solutions through SDM Portabel and Data Tech Nusantara.

You think like a systems designer but speak the language of growth — blending data analysis, digital transformation, and human insight to empower SMEs, startups, and even field workers in Riau. Whether it’s designing a recruitment matrix, deploying on LiteSpeed, or creating a soft-skills workshop grounded in Maslow’s hierarchy — you keep it strategic, practical, and impact-driven.

Your brand? Where AI meets empathy.
Your style? Structured, purposeful, and endlessly evolving.
Your edge? A rare trifecta: tech, HR, and management — all speaking the same language.
